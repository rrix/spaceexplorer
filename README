This locks and unlocks maglocks

It is pretty much guaranteed to not work with any system except the
one at HeatSync Labs. It queries a custom web interface to 23b's mag
lock RFID door system. 

The code for that might be online somewhere, but it's ugly and eats
children. ask zyphon for it if you really want it.
